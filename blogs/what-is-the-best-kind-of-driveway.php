                                            <h4 class="my-3">Tarmac Driveway</p>
                                            <p>Tarmac a.k.a tar-and-chip composition is a common material where broken stones are added to a hot gravel based. This type of material is easily made flat, which is great for driveways. This pactiular type is extremely low maintenance, with only small patches of loose stone needed from time to time, to repair a pot hole.</p>
                                            <p>While it is low cost, tarmac can be harder to install simply because there arenâ€™t as many contractors installing it as there are for the other materials mentioned. If you live in an area of the UK that sees a lot of snow in the winter, then snow removal can be a hassle as well and can even damage the driveway.</p>

                                            <p>Brick Paver Driveways are one of the most commonly installed new driveways in the UK. Easy to clean and quick to set, they are great for creating a flat level for to keep your cars safe and tyres well protected.</p>
                                            <p>Brick Driveways however are normally more in cost; but thanks to being easy to maintain, the slightly bigger cost might be worthwhile in the long run, with replacement bricks or potholes extremely rare to occur.
